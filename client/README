and then call them with crontab

0. Dependencies
   0.1 packages:
       Required: bc mysql-client dput pbuilder uuid-runtime ntp less dpkg-dev sudo
       Suggestion or Requried with some other options:
             vim bc kexec-tools eatmydata ntp
   0.2 you will need to add `deb-src' entries into /etc/apt/sources.list,
       to help getting source packages
   0.3 You will need `NOPASSWD' sudo permission,
       Or add `NOPASSWD' sudo permission for pbuilder and `apt-get update'
   0.4 You will need password-free ssh key config to the server,
       for create lock and upload packages

1. pbuilder chroot targz
   1.1 pbuilder chroot targz should be in `chroot' directory and with the name
       `SUITE-ARCH.tar.gz', for example `sid-amd64.tar.gz'
       
       You can use `sh ~/chroot/bin/update-chroot.sh ARCH SUITE' to update chroot targz
   1.2 Install `eatmydata' for both in and out of chroot is suggested

2. To build package, you can invoke: `cd chroot; bash bin/build-client.sh ARCH SUITE'

3. chroot/bin/dput.cf: the identifier should be the same with `database name',
       for example: `debiansid'/`ubuntuxenial' etc
   TODO: generate dput.cf dynamicly

4. chroot/bin/buildd-client.conf: 
   4.1 eval to get the repo name of dists:
               sid=debian
       This is used to get DB name etc.
   4.2 eval to get the directory name in server of the project
               debian=debian-avx
       This means that we put `debian' in a directory named `debian-avx'
   4.3 allowed_arch/allowed_dist: restricted to these arch and dist

5. pbuilderrc/pbuilderrc-nocheck: pbuilder configuration for pbuild
   TODO: generate pbuilderrc dynamicly
